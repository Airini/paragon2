                    The following case studies have been performed using Paragon so far:

                <h3>
                    Sealed Bids Auction
                </h3>
				<p>
					The sealed bids auction is an example where bidders can place a bid
                    that remains secret until the auction is over and can only flow
                    to the other bidders if their bid is the winning bid.
				</p>
                <p>
                    Download the sealed bid auction
                    <a href="sealedbids.zip">here</a> and
                    run under Linux <span class="code">make</span>, possibly followed by 
                    <span class="code">make java</span>. Note that at this moment runtime
                    lock querying is not correctly translated into Java files which makes
                    it not possible to compile them.

                    Mental Poker
                </h3>
				<p>
					A Paragon implementation of the first large program written in Jif,
                    which was described 
                    <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/5clup4c2332rw06g/">here</a> by Askarov and Sabelfeld.
                    There are two versions of the Paragon implementation.
				</p>
                <p>
                    <a href="mentalPokerParagonv1.zip">Version 1</a>
                    is an almost direct translation of the original work with
                    only a few differences (in particular having a trusted
                    declassifier and providing static guarantees instead of
                    Jif's seal pattern).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="mentalPokerParagonv2.zip">Version 2</a>
                    uses more of the expressive power of Paragon and where the
                    original version had the same policy for all sensitive data, 
                    more flexible policies are here depending on how the data is used.
                    A description can be found in
                    <a href="draft_paragon.pdf">this</a> draft paper on Paragon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To compile, make sure that 
                    Paragon is installed and the runtime jar is located in the top
                    directory of the extracted zip file (see 
                    <a href="download.html">Download Paragon</a>).
                    Under Windows the example can be built by executing 
                    <span class="code">make.bat</span>, under Linux by running
                    <span class="code">make</span>, possibly followed by 
                    <span class="code">make java</span>.
                    The resulting Mental Poker class files can then be run calling
                    <span class="code">binder.py</span>.
