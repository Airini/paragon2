We here describe how the operations on Paralocks policies are implemented.

\section{Least Upper Bound or Join operation}

The Least Upper Bound (LUB) operator computes exactly the join of two policies 
(as shown in -- TODO ref Datalog --). That is, it never under-approximates the
allowed information flows. Given two policies \smallcode{p} and \smallcode{q}, the LUB 
is computed as follows:
